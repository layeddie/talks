[^1]: yak shave (noun): Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows you to solve a larger problem.

# Thousand Island
### A pure Elixir socket server, embodying OTP ideals

* Sits underneath an e.g. HTTP server
* Listens for client connections over TCP
* Hands them off to an upper protocol layer
* Provides send / receive / &c functionality
* Handles transport concerns (TLS, connection draining, etc)
* Does this efficiently and scalably

^ But before we talk about this, we'll need a bit of context
^ This isn't just a really about Thousand Island, it's really a talk about yak shaving and air conditioners

^ We have one of these units in our house, and like most of them, it comes with a remote like this

^ It's functional, but not much more. You never use it enough to remember which buttons are which, and more notably, there's no ability to use it out of the house. 
^ I can fix this; I'll make an IR blaster to control it via a RPi, over the internet

## HomeKit devices run an HTTP server

![Fit Original](ir_overview_3.pdf)

^ There's a problem

---
## HomeKit devices run a *non-standard* HTTP server 

![Fit Original](ir_overview_4.pdf)

^ The long and short of it is that we need to do encryption directly on the socket connection. This isn't SSL, but rather a simpler symmetric encryption directly on the wire that uses a key negotiated further up the protocol stack. It's a sensible design for the sorts of embedded environments that IoT devices live in, but it's not something that any higher level stack provides out of the box. 

^ This is a great model. Almost all of the pieces are in the right place, but cowboy and ranch are at the harder to read end of erlang, imo. So fitting the necessary low-level control hooks into this stack isn't gonna be fun

# Bandit
## A Plug-First Web Server

---
[.build-lists: true]
# What does a Web Server do, exactly?

1. Listen for connections
2. Handle each connection
  1. Parse an HTTP request into a `Plug.Conn` struct
  2. Pass this struct to a `Plug` implementation such as Phoenix
  3. Provide backing support for `Plug.Conn.send_resp`, &c.

---
# Problem naturally splits into two parts

1. Listen for connections (socket server, e.g: Thousand Island or ranch)
2. Handle each connection (web server, e.g: Bandit or Cowboy)

^ So I can't build a proper webserver until I build a proper socket server. How hard can it be, right?
